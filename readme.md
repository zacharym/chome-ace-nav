## Quickly Navigate Your Browser Via the Keyboard

### Up and Running
This is still under development so you can't find it in the extension store but you can get in running by cloning the repo and following these instructions:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

### Usage
  * see all the links on a given page: `Control - j`
  * links will filter as you type part of the title of the result. Results are not case-sensative.
  * follow link: `return`
  * cancel: `Control - k`


I recommend using this plugin in conjunction with this:
